### **\#7: The specialized Talent Trees (ROOT\_ADMINISTRATOR)**

When `${PLAYER_NAME}` reaches Level 100, they are no longer just a "User." They transcend to a **Root Class**. You choose one specialization, unlocking a unique talent tree that defines your end-game "exploit" style.

#### **1\. The Digital Bouncer (The Enforcer)**

* **Focus:** **CORE\_INTEGRITY** and high-impact physical-code collisions.  
* **Unique Talent: \[HARD\_RESET\]**.  
  * **The Mechanic:** A physical "shove" that deals damage based on 20% of your current HP. If the target is pushed into a wall, they are "Stunned" (Clock Speed \= 0\) for 2 seconds.  
* **End-Game Perk: \[KERNEL\_DENSITY\]**.  
  * Permanent 30% reduction in all incoming damage, but you lose the ability to use **STEALTH** scripts. You are too "loud" in the system to hide.

#### **2\. The Exploit Artist (The Ghost/Hacker)**

* **Focus:** **CLOCK\_SPEED** and **Information Superiority**.  
* **Unique Talent: \[SUDO\_LOCATE\_EXIT\]**.  
  * **The Mechanic:** (As discussed) The only class that can force the exit portal to reveal itself through walls for a high M-RAM cost.  
* **End-Game Perk: \[PACKET\_GHOST\]**.  
  * While **STEALTH** is active, you can move through **Stateless Sentries** without colliding. Every time you pass "through" an enemy, you siphon 5 M-RAM.

#### **3\. The Fabricator (The Architect)**

* **Focus:** **M-RAM\_CAPACITY** and **ECHO\_01** synergy.  
* **Unique Talent: \[RE-COMPILE\_FRIEND\]**.  
  * **The Mechanic:** Point at a de-compiled enemy "Static Pile" and spend 50 eBits to revive them as a temporary ally for 60 seconds.  
* **End-Game Perk: \[DISTRIBUTED\_PROCESSING\]**.  
  * **ECHO\_01** can now carry and fire *two* scripts at once. You essentially have a second player-character under your control.

To ensure the **ROOT\_ADMINISTRATOR** classes feel earned and balanced, we need to shift from "instant god-mode" to a **tiered permission hierarchy**. Instead of a single Level 100 power-spike, we will distribute "System Breakthroughs" across the deep-layer milestones (250, 500, 750, 1000).  
This ensures that while a Level 100 player is powerful, a Level 500 player is a different species of "Anomalous Process."

### **I. The "Permission Elevation" Roadmap**

We will restructure the Skill Trees so that the initial Level 100 choice is just the **"Kernel Handshake."** The true power unlocks as you breach deeper partitions.

#### **1\. The Digital Bouncer (Enforcer Class)**

* **Lvl 100 \[HARD\_RESET\]:** A physical shove dealing 10% HP damage and a 1s stun.  
* **Lvl 250 \[KINETIC\_CACHE\]:** Every time you shove an enemy, you "absorb" their kinetic energy, granting a 5s buff that reduces your next script's M-RAM cost by 20%.  
* **Lvl 500 \[RECURSIVE\_IMPACT\]:** If a shoved enemy hits another enemy, both are de-compiled instantly if they are below 25% health.  
* **Lvl 750 \[FORCE\_FIELD\_OVERLOAD\]:** Your **OBJECT\_SHELL** now deals damage to enemies that touch it. You become a walking "Delete" zone.  
* **Lvl 1000 \[SYSTEM\_COLLAPSE\]:** For 10 seconds, you can "Charge" through walls, de-compiling everything in your path. (Triggers 5-minute Scrub).

#### **2\. The Exploit Artist (Infiltrator Class)**

* **Lvl 100 \[SUDO\_LOCATE\_EXIT\]:** High M-RAM cost to pulse the exit location for 5s.  
* **Lvl 250 \[PHASE\_SYNC\]:** While **STEALTH** is active, your move speed is increased by 50%.  
* **Lvl 500 \[LOGIC\_GHOST\]:** You can "Possess" a **Stateless Sentry**, seeing through its eyes and using its position to scout the next 10 tiles of the maze.  
* **Lvl 750 \[CHMOD\_777\]:** You gain "Full Write Access" to the floor. For 15 seconds, traps do not trigger, and enemy projectiles pass through you.  
* **Lvl 1000 \[ZERO\_DAY\_EXPLOIT\]:** You can instantly teleport to the Exit Portal if you are within 30 tiles. (Triggers 10-minute Scrub).

#### **3\. The Fabricator (Architect Class)**

* **Lvl 100 \[RE-COMPILE\_FRIEND\]:** Spend 50 eBits to revive a basic Sentry as an ally.  
* **Lvl 250 \[MULTI-THREAD\_ECHO\]:** **ECHO\_01** splits into two identical drones. Each can hold its own script relay.  
* **Lvl 500 \[RESOURCE\_FORGE\]:** You can de-compile your own **M-RAM** to create a temporary "Safe Node" (Healing circle) in the middle of the maze.  
* **Lvl 750 \[NETWORK\_UPRISING\]:** Revived allies gain the **\[PROTECTED\]** status for 10 seconds after spawning.  
* **Lvl 1000 \[THE\_SINGULARITY\]:** **ECHO\_01** absorbs all nearby eBits and explodes in a 10-tile radius of pure Magenta chaos, dealing 500% damage.

### **II. Tiered Skill Boosting**

Instead of new abilities every level, we will implement **Version Control (v1.0 \-\> v5.0)** for your base scripts.

| Level | Version | Effect |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **250** | **v2.0 (Stable)** | Script M-RAM costs reduced by 15%. |
| **500** | **v3.0 (Optimized)** | Script casting speed (Animation time) reduced by 25%. |
| **750** | **v4.0 (Overclocked)** | Critical hit chance on \[VULNERABLE\] tags increased by 20%. |
| **1000** | **v5.0 (Apex)** | All scripts gain a secondary "Glitch Effect" (e.g., Data\_Spike now chains to a second target). |

---

### **III. The "Elite Hacker" Persistence Note**

In **Elite Mode (Permadeath)**, these high-level unlocks are the only things that make Floors 500+ survivable. By stretching the power out, we ensure the player never feels "finished." They are always one breakthrough away from the next tier of system control.

**Instruction for `LOGIC_BREACH_02` (The Engineer):**

"Engineer, build the **Directives Interface**. At floor start, present the `[Y/N]` prompt. If `Y`, enable the specific quest logic and the `FAILURE_PENALTY` routine. Ensure no mechanics require vertical jumping."
