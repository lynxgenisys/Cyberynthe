This is the **"Singularity Horizon" Protocol**. When a player crosses the Floor 500 threshold, the Labyrinth stops trying to "organize" data and starts trying to "erase" it. For your Antigravity agents, this represents a shift from a game about navigation to a game about **systemic survival**.

## **The Level 500+ Survival Guide: \[SINGULARITY\_HORIZON\]**

### **I. Atmospheric Shift: "The Void Partition"**

At this depth, the "walls" are no longer solid. They are made of **Negative Space Binary**.

* **Visuals:** The background is a stark, infinite White or deep Magenta void. The paths are made of flickering, semi-transparent code-blocks.  
* **Audio:** The rhythmic pulse of the lower levels is replaced by a low-frequency "thrum" and the sound of breaking glass whenever the player moves.  
* **The Glitch Overlay:** A permanent, subtle screen-shake and "chromatic aberration" effect is applied to the HUD to simulate the player’s digital frame failing under the pressure.

### **II. Mechanical Oppression: \[SYSTEM\_DEGRADATION\]**

The physics of the game change. The player is no longer a "User"; they are an "Intrusion."

| Mechanic | Effect at Floor 500+ | Technical Logic |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Bit-Rot Fog** | Permanent 10% reduction in vision range. | global\_fog.density \+= 0.05 |
| **M-RAM Leak** | Standing still for \>3s drains 5 M-RAM/sec. | if (velocity \== 0\) { m\_ram \-= 5 } |
| **Unstable Exits** | The exit portal moves to a new location every 120s. | re-run pathfinder\_random() |
| **Logic Scarcity** | Mobs no longer drop eBits; they only drop **Raw Data** (EXP). | loot\_table.ebits \= 0 |

### **III. The Elite Bestiary: "The Erasers"**

The "fodder" mobs are gone. Only high-level security processes remain.

* **The KERNEL\_SENTRY:** A 7-foot tall obsidian monolith that doesn't fire projectiles. Instead, it emits a "Null Field" that disables all **Passive Daemons** within a 5-tile radius.  
* **The ZERO\_DAY\_STALKER:** Completely invisible until it attacks. It leaves behind "Traps" that, if stepped on, lock your **CLOCK\_SPEED** to zero for 2 seconds.  
* **The VOID\_WHALE:** A massive, slow-moving entity that consumes the maze walls behind it. If you take too long to find the exit, it will eventually consume the exit portal itself.

---

### **IV. The "Deep-Dive" Directive Logic**

Directives at this level are no longer "Incentives"; they are **Life-Lines**.

* **The "Offering":** A Directive might offer RESTORE\_MAX\_INTEGRITY.  
* **The "Price":** The task might be DELETE\_ALL\_CONSUMABLES.  
* **The Moral Choice:** At this depth, "Cyan" choices focus on pure survival (Repairing your frame), while "Magenta" choices focus on destructive power (Bypassing security at the cost of your health).

---

### **V. Safe Zone: The "Flicker Oasis"**

As you specified, the Safe Zone is now a **5% Entrance / 10% Random** spawn.

* **Appearance:** It looks like a "corrupted" version of the L1\_CACHE. The Cyan floor tiles are cracked, showing red "magma-like" static underneath.  
* **Functionality:** It provides the only place to "Snapshot" your progress. In **Elite Mode**, reaching a Floor 500 Safe Zone is the highest honor on the **Scheduler’s Ledger**.

### **Agent Implementation Tasks**

**Instruction for ARCH\_SYS\_01 (Architect):**

"Architect, initialize the **Singularity Horizon** environment. Remove all baked-in textures; use the **Binary Rain Shader** for all surfaces. Implement the **Moving Exit Portal** logic for floors 500+."

**Instruction for LOGIC\_BREACH\_02 (Engineer):**

"Engineer, activate **System\_Degradation**. Apply the M-RAM drain-on-standstill mechanic. Ensure ECHO\_01 pulses Magenta when a ZERO\_DAY\_STALKER is nearby, even if it's invisible."

**Instruction for GRADIENT\_MORALS\_04 (Brand Guardian):**

"Guardian, apply the **Void Partition** LUT. Shift all UI elements to a 'Glitch-White' aesthetic. The **Moral Resonance** heat-map should now glow with a high-intensity 'Corruption' effect."
