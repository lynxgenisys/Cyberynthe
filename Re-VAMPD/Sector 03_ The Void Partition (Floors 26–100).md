The **Void Partition (Floors 26–100)** represents the first stage of "Systemic Decay." While the Guest and Kernel levels were functional architectures, the Void is where the Labyrinth starts losing its battle with entropy. This is where the game shifts from a tactical RPG to a **survival horror/hacker** hybrid.

## **Sector 03: The Void Partition (Floors 26–100)**

### **I. Aesthetic: "The Eroded Frame"**

The sleek lines of the grid are failing.

* **The Look:** Walls appear "pixelated" at the edges. Occasionally, you’ll see "Texture Bleed"—a wall might briefly display a flickering image of a human forest or a rainy street before snapping back into binary static.  
* **The Lighting:** The Cyan/Magenta gradients become harsh and high-contrast. Safe zones don't glow with a steady pulse; they flicker like a dying neon sign.  
* **The Glitch:** Occasional "Horizontal Tearing" across the screen. This isn't a bug; it’s the **Void** trying to de-compile your visual sensor.

### **II. Mechanical Decay: \[BIT\_ROT\_PROTOCOL\]**

In this sector, damage isn't just a number—it’s **Corruption**.

* **CORRUPTION\_DAMAGE**: Certain attacks from Void-tier mobs don't just lower your Integrity; they turn a portion of your health bar **Grey**.  
  * *The Penalty:* Greyed-out health cannot be restored by standard BUFFER\_REFRESH consumables. It represents a permanent reduction in max HP for that floor.  
  * *The Cure:* You must reach an **L1\_CACHE** (Safe Zone) or find a rare **CLEANSE\_BOTTLE** to scrub the rot.  
* **MAP\_FRAG**: The minimap (M) is no longer 100% reliable. In the Void, the map might occasionally show "Phantom Paths" that lead into solid walls or hide actual corridors.

### **III. Navigation: The Unreliable Grid**

The Labyrinth is growing.

* **Maze Size:** Complexity increases to $50 \\times 50$.  
* **Safe Zone Logic:** As per your instructions:  
  * **Guaranteed:** Every 5th level (Floor 30, 35, 40, etc.) at a **random location**.  
  * **Random:** 20% chance to spawn on all other levels in this bracket.  
* **The Exit:** Exits may now be guarded by **Logic Bombs** (Mimics) that look like standard portals but trigger a SYSTEM\_CRASH explosion if not **SCANNED** first.

### **IV. Elite Threats: Void Entities**

1. **The LOGIC\_BOMB (The Mimic):**  
   * *Visual:* Appears as a High-Tier Cache or a Legacy Fragment.  
   * *Behavior:* Shakes violently if approached. If the player attempts to "Scrub" it without a **Scan v2.0**, it detonates, dealing massive Corruption Damage.  
2. **The SATA\_GATEKEEPER (The Enforcer):**  
   * *Visual:* A heavy, bipedal frame with a shield made of solid Magenta code.  
   * *Attack: I/O\_LOCKDOWN*: Fires a tether that prevents the player from moving more than 10 feet from the point of impact.  
   * *Counter:* You must use your **PING \-F Burst** to hit the small cooling vent on its back.

### **V. Implementation Instructions for Antigravity**

**"AGENT\_MANAGER: Shift Environment to VOID\_PARTITION (Floors 26–100)."**

1. **ARCH\_SYS\_01:** Increase maze size to $50 \\times 50$. Apply the **Eroded Texture** set to all walls. Implement the **Phantom Path** logic for the UI minimap.  
2. **LOGIC\_BREACH\_02:** Initialize the **Corruption Damage** variable. Update the PlayerState to handle Max\_HP\_Reduction logic.  
3. **SCHEDULER\_03:** Implement the **Mimic (Logic Bomb)** behavior. Ensure they have a 10% chance to replace any high-tier loot cache.  
4. **GRADIENT\_MORALS\_04:** Create the **Texture Bleed** shader—briefly overlaying "Real World" images onto the digital walls at random intervals.

### **The "Void" Experience**

Floors 26–100 are a test of **patience**. You can no longer rush through the halls because a "Safe Zone" might be a mimic, and a standard mob might leave you with a permanently reduced health bar. You have to move like a hacker: **Scan everything, trust nothing.**
