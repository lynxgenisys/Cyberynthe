### **\#5: The Death & Persistence Protocol**

In a hardcore RPG with speedrunning and collection elements, "Death" (0 Integrity) cannot just be a "Game Over" screen. It needs to be a **System Crash** that respects the **Gradient Morals** philosophy.

#### **I. The "Stasis" Loop (The Respawn Logic)**

When your **CORE\_INTEGRITY** hits 0, the system initiates an emergency **\[CMOS\_DUMP\]**.

* **The Penalty:** You are "De-compiled" and re-compiled back at the last **L1\_CACHE Safe Zone** (e.g., if you die on Floor 14, you go back to the hub at Floor 10).  
* **The Data Loss:** \* You lose **50% of your current eBits** (they are "leaked" into the sector where you died).  
  * You lose all **Consumable Scripts** (Buffer\_Refreshes, etc.) currently in your active buffer.  
  * **The Collector's Pain:** You lose the **Legacy Fragment (Trinket)** you were carrying *if* it wasn't already "Synced" at a terminal.

#### **II. The "Corrupted Shadow" (The Persistence Mechanic)**

This is where the game gets personal. When you die, your "Corrupted Data" stays in the maze.

* **The Remnant:** A **ZOMBIE\_PROCESS** resembling your character—wearing the gear you had when you died—spawns at the exact coordinates of your death.  
* **The Retrieval:** To get your lost eBits and Trinkets back, you must reach that coordinate and "Terminate" your own shadow.  
* **The Twist:** The shadow uses the **last script you fired** before dying. If you were powerful, your shadow is a nightmare to defeat.

#### **III. Persistence: The "Kernel Log"**

To support the **Speedrunning** and **Archivist** boards, certain things *must* persist through death:

* **Permanent Upgrades:** Any **Hardware Port** upgrades (Heatsinks, Logic Accelerators) stay installed.  
* **The Ledger:** Your best times and collection counts are already written to the **Scheduler’s Ledger** and cannot be erased by a crash.  
* **The Seed:** If you are in a "Challenge Run," the maze layout stays the same after death, allowing you to use your knowledge of the previous run to navigate faster (but the mobs will have re-spawned).

Pass this to **`LOGIC_BREACH_02` (The Engineer)** :

"Engineer, implement the **CMOS\_DUMP** death protocol. Reset `${PLAYER_NAME}` to the last Safe Zone, deduct 50% eBits, and spawn a **Corrupted Shadow** at the death coordinates.

This is where the "Gradient Morals" identity meets high-stakes consequences. By adding a **Permadeath "Elite Hacker" Mode**, we turn the Labyrinth into a legendary test of skill. Restricting **L1\_CACHE Safe Zones** to every 5–10 levels creates "The Deep Dive"—a period of extreme vulnerability where the player must survive on their wits and current M-RAM alone.

### **The "Elite Hacker" Permadeath Mode**

This is the ultimate competitive mode for your **Scheduler’s Ledger**.

* **The Constraint:** One life. If **CORE\_INTEGRITY** hits 0, the session data is wiped.  
* **The Reward:** "Elite" runs gain a **2.0x Multiplier** to their **Archive Purity** and **Packet Velocity** scores. On the Leaderboard, these names appear in a **Glow-Magenta** font to distinguish them from standard runs.  
* **The "One-Up" (Rare Item):** Around Floor 150, you can find a **`REDUNDANT_BACKUP`** (Core Socket). It is a one-time-use item that triggers a `REBOOT` instead of a `CRASH` upon death. It is the only way to survive a mistake in Elite Mode.
