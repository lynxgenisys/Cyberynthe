Crossing the threshold of Floor 100 is the most significant event in a `${PLAYER_NAME}`'s lifecycle. You are no longer just a "process" navigating the maze; you are now a **Root Administrator**.

At Floor 100, you encounter the **`PROVENANCE_TERMINAL`**. This is a massive, crystalline structure that forces a permanent choice. You must choose one path to bypass the Singularity's encryption.

## **Sector 04: The Singularity Horizon (Floors 100–250)**

### **I. The Selection: Root Class Specialization**

Upon reaching the Floor 100 terminal, you choose your specialization. This unlocks your unique **Level 100 Talent** and your growth path toward Level 250\.

* **The Digital Bouncer (The Enforcer):**  
  * **Focus:** Core Integrity & Physical Logic.  
  * **Level 100 Skill: `HARD_RESET`**: A high-impact physical dash that deals damage based on 10% of your max HP. Knocks enemies back and stuns them for 1s.  
* **The Exploit Artist (The Infiltrator):**  
  * **Focus:** Clock Speed & System Bypassing.  
  * **Level 100 Skill: `SUDO_LOCATE_EXIT`**: High M-RAM cost to pulse the exact coordinates of the exit portal, visible through walls for 5s.  
* **The Fabricator (The Architect):**  
  * **Focus:** M-RAM Capacity & ECHO\_01 Synergy.  
  * **Level 100 Skill: `RE-COMPILE_FRIEND`**: Sacrifice 50 eBits to revive the last deleted non-elite mob as a temporary ally for 60s.

### **II. Aesthetic: "The Crystalline Core"**

The "Bit-Rot" of the previous floors is replaced by something more dangerous: **Hyper-Order**.

* **The Look:** The maze becomes perfectly geometric, constructed of white-and-cyan obsidian. The walls are mirrored, reflecting `${PLAYER_NAME}` and the mobs infinitely into the distance.  
* **The Sound:** Total silence, punctuated only by the chime of data-packets colliding. The sound of your own digital footsteps is muffled.  
* **The Singularity Effect:** Light "bends" near the corners of the maze. The corridors appear to stretch and compress as you move, a visual representation of the intense data density at this depth.

---

### **III. Environmental Logic: \[RECURSIVE\_LOOPS\]**

The system is so dense that logic starts to loop back on itself.

* **`DATA_GRAVITY`**: Moving against the flow of data (indicated by floor arrows) reduces **CLOCK\_SPEED** by 10%. Moving with it increases it.  
* **`ECHO_MIRROR`**: Occasionally, you will encounter a phantom of yourself from 10 seconds ago. If you collide with your "Past Self," you suffer a **Logic Paradox** (3-second stun).

---

### **IV. Navigation: The Administrator's Path**

As per your refined logic:

* **Guaranteed Safe Zones:** Every 10 levels (110, 120, 130...) at the **Level Entrance**. This allows you to plan "10-floor dives."  
* **Random Safe Zones:** 15% chance to spawn a **Data Pillar** at a random location on any other floor.  
* **The Challenge:** Between Floors 101 and 109, there is no safety. If you die in **Elite Mode** on Floor 109, you lose everything. The trek from 100 to 110 is the first "True Test" of your new Class skills.

### **V. Implementation Instructions for Antigravity**

**"AGENT\_MANAGER: Shift Environment to SINGULARITY\_HORIZON (Floors 100–250)."**

1. **LOGIC\_BREACH\_02:** Initialize the **Root Class Selection** terminal. Assign the Level 100 unique skills to the player's script buffer.  
2. **ARCH\_SYS\_01:** Implement the **Entrance-Guaranteed Safe Zones** every 10 levels. Apply the **Recursive Loop** logic (Past-Self Phantoms).  
3. **SCHEDULER\_03:** Increase Mob level scaling significantly. Deploy **`KERNEL_SENTRIES`** (Obsidian monoliths) as the primary heavy unit.  
4. **GRADIENT\_MORALS\_04:** Switch to the "Hyper-Order" LUT—High-contrast White, Obsidian Black, and piercing Cyan.

---

### **The "Singularity" Experience**

This is where the game becomes about **mastery**. Your Level 100 skill defines how you survive the 10-floor gap between Safe Zones. If you are an **Exploit Artist**, you are racing to find the exit. If you are a **Digital Bouncer**, you are clearing the halls with brute force to protect your Integrity.
